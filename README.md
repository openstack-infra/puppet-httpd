## Overview


puppet-httpd is the openstack-infra fork of puppetlabs-apache. We
forked at the 0.0.4 release.


## Why we forked


We forked because we were unable to upgrade to later versions of the
apache module, and in some cases because we were unwilling to do this.
The modern apache module takes the position of fully modelling the
apache config file. The older module, that this forked from, takes the
position of weakly modelling, it accepts a template and puts that in a
vhost. This allows us to write our vhosts in the apache syntax with a
thin erb layer on top of it.

However, with the apache module pinned to 0.0.4, we were unable to
bring in new modules that depended on a newer apache module. Groups
who consumed our puppet code downstream couldn't use the modern apache
module either.

We forked to the httpd namespace so that this module (weakly modelling)
and a modern puppetlabs-apache module (strongly modelling) could
co-exist.

This also allows us to add features and bugfixes to this module
without changing its weakly modelled architecture.

## Defined types


httpd::vhost


The vhost defined type can take a 'template' string which is a
template uri for puppet to evaluate. 

::httpd::vhost { 'status.openstack.org':
  port     => 80,
  priority => '50',
  docroot  => '/srv/static/status',
  template => 'openstack_project/status.vhost.erb',
  require  => File['/srv/static/status'],
}

The vhost can also take a 'content' string which will be the content of the vhost.
This is preferable because puppet then evaluates the template in the scope
of the class including the vhost template.

$port = 80
$docroot = '/srv/static/status'
$vhost_name = 'status.openstack.org'
::httpd::vhost { $vhost_name:
  port     => $port,
  priority => '50',
  docroot  => $docroot,
  content  => template('openstack_project/status.vhost.erb'),
  require  => File['/srv/static/status'],
}

These values need to be set in variables so that the template function can pick
them up. This new syntax is experimental and should be improved upon.

Though this project is mirrored to github, that is just a mirror. This
is a sub project under the OpenStack umbrella, and so has more process
associated with it than your typical Puppet module.

This module is under the direction of the openstack-infra team.
